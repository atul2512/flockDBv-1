# flockDBv-1
FlockDB version -1

This is an attempt to learn and write a database.The plan is to understand the LLD and HLD of flockDB and then write it myself.I picked up flockDB as its a comparatively smaller code base.

Execution Plan:
- Understand a basic idea of how database works.
- Understand the HLD of FlockDb
- Write the HLD, without implementing, how it works.
- Understand LLD.
- Write LLD, without implementing the OS related task.
- Understand OS related design
- Write it.
- Work on making it distributed and fault tolerant.
- Replication

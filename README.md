# flockDBv-1
FlockDB version -1

This is an attempt to learn and write a database.The plan is to understand the LLD and HLD of flockDB and then write it myself.

I picked up flockDB as its a comparatively smaller code base.

Execution Plan:
a)Understand a basic idea of how database works.
b)Understand the HLD of FlockDb
c)Write the HLD, without implementing, how it works.
d)Understand LLD.
e)Write LLD, without implementing the OS related task.
f)Understand OS related design
g)Write it.
h)Work on making it distributed and fault tolerant.
i)Replication
